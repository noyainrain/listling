# onboard

* first collaborative action ask for name / client Activity
* CONTINUE refactor to activity
  * -> make EventTarget cross browser compatible
* OQ how to update user on page
  * maybe for now okay and a problem for later
  * a) let user elems subscribe and change
       -> user in bound data may differ from user in elem then :/ - hide somehow?
  * b) let page handle it and update e.g. list of greetings
       -> overhead :/
